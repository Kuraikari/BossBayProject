## Introduction 
Firstly, thanks for visiting my repository! I'm glad to see, that this is getting seen by others and I'm hoping that even more get to see it. 

This repo is mainly a playground for myself, but it can be used as a default website to start off. it has the most used features and is OOP. It will be more of a future reference, when I apply for jobs, that I can show how I work and what I'm capable of.
