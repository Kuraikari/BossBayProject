## Introduction 
Firstly, thanks for visiting my repository! I'm glad to see, that this is getting seen by others and I'm hoping that even more get to see it. 

This repo is mainly a playground for myself, but it can be used as a default website to start off. it has the most used features and is OOP. 

## Features 
At the moment there are some things that are there just for fun and don't have any further purpose, at least right now.
